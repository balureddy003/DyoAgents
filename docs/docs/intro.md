# Welcome to Dyogents

**Dyogents** is an open-source platform for orchestrating intelligent, modular teams of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). It is designed to help businesses and developers automate workflows, integrate with real-world systems, and manage AI agents with governance and observability in mind.

## ðŸ§  What is Dyogents?

Dyogents lets you compose and deploy agents like building blocks. These agents can:
- Reason, act, and collaborate based on goals
- Plug into tools like Kafka, SAP, Salesforce, and IoT systems
- Use OpenAI, Ollama, Claude, or HuggingFace as LLM backends
- Operate under cost and security policies

Whether you're building smart factory diagnostics or automating invoice workflows, Dyogents gives you the foundation to do it.
